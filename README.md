# iLanders - Optimal Route Planning for Island Deliveries

## Overview

iLanders is an innovative project developed during the HackDelft 2024 Hackathon organized by TU Delft University. This tool is designed to optimize delivery routes across multiple delivery points, focusing on reducing costs and improving efficiency. By leveraging linear programming and geospatial analysis, iLanders calculates the best possible routes considering distance, time, and delivery constraints.

## Features

- **Optimal Route Calculation:** Utilizes linear programming to determine the most efficient delivery routes.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Incorporates geospatial data to accurately map and calculate routes.
- **Cost Reduction:** Aims to minimize delivery costs through optimized route planning.
- **Time Management:** Ensures timely deliveries by considering various constraints and parameters.

## Tech Stack

- **Python:** Core programming language used for development.
- **Linear Programming:** Mathematical approach to optimize the delivery routes.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Tools and libraries for handling and analyzing geospatial data.

## Challenges Addressed

- Complex route planning across multiple islands.
- Efficient distance and time calculations.
- Balancing various delivery constraints to achieve optimal results.

## Achievements

- Developed a functional tool that successfully calculates optimal delivery routes.
- Gained valuable experience in problem-solving, teamwork, and innovation in logistics.
- Recognized for the ability to tackle real-world challenges during the hackathon.
